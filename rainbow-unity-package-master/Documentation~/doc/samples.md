# Samples shipped with the **Rainbow Unity SDK WebRTC**:


**Rainbow Unity SDK WebRTC** ships with two examples scenes and scripts.

+ `Basic Rainbow Sample` is a very basic rainbow client application which is able to start or join a conference or a p2p call, publish a video stream and a sharing stream,
 and display up to one remote video stream and up to one remote sharing stream.
 
 It also features a little UI which offers support for DataChannel.
 More information can be found here [Basic Rainbow Sample](./sample1.md).

 + `Mini Rainbow Client` demonstrates how to display multiple remote video in a conference, displays the list of participants,
  and partially mimics the look of regular Rainbow clients. 

  ⚠️ **Mini Rainbow Client has extra dependencies on external unity packages.**

More information can be found here [Rainbow Mini Client Sample](./sample2.md).
