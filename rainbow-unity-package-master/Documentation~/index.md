# Rainbow Unity SDK WebRTC
 
**Rainbow Unity SDK WebRTC** is a package that allows unity applications to integrate features from [Rainbow C# SDK WebRTC](https://developers.openrainbow.com/doc/sdk/csharp/home).

It gives access to core rainbow features (im, chat, bubble management etc..) as well as webrtc communications (joining a call or a conference, publishing and receiving audio and video).

## Prerequisites
To be able to use the SDK, you need to be a registered rainbow developer and have created an application (go to [Rainbow Developer Site](https://developers.openrainbow.com) ).

You will also need at least two users to be able to test communications. 

## Installation

+ First install [WebRTC for Unity](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc)

The installation instructions can be found on [this page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/com.unity.webrtc/blob/main/Documentation~/install.md)

+ Then follow the steps described in [Install package](doc/install.md).

## Sample applications

The **Rainbow Unity SDK WebRTC** package contains a couple of sample applications. To try it follow the steps described [here](doc/samples.md).

## Developping with the **Rainbow SDK**

Although [Rainbow Developer site](https://developers.openrainbow.com/doc/sdk/csharp/home) is the reference regarding the Rainbow C# SDK, a quick walkthrough can be found  [here](doc/developing_general.md) to help figure out how it can be used to leverage features.
